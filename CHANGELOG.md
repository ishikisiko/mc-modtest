# Changelog

All notable project changes should be recorded here when a version is prepared.

## Versioning Rules

- Large feature additions bump the middle version component and reset the patch
  component: `0.x.y` -> `0.(x+1).0`.
- Small feature additions bump the patch component: `0.x.y` -> `0.x.(y+1)`.
- Single verified fixes keep the base version and add an ordered fix suffix:
  `0.x.y-fix1`, `0.x.y-fix2`, and so on.
- A fix suffix should only be added after the fix passes the relevant
  validation or build step.
- Any version change must update `gradle.properties`,
  `src/main/resources/META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`, README jar-name examples,
  and this changelog in the same change.

## Unreleased

## 0.8.1-fix2

### Fixed

- Closed the corner holes in the upper stories of pagoda buildings
  (`scripture_pavilion`). The stairwell was reserved flush against the volume
  edge, but pagoda story insets step the upper-floor perimeter walls inward
  onto that shaft; the stair's protected void then blocked the inset wall from
  sealing, leaving open corners on the 2nd and 3rd floors. `_reserve_stairwell`
  now offsets the shaft inward by the deepest story inset so it stays inside
  the most-inset footprint and the outer shell closes on every story. Visible
  in `cultivation_sect_001` (summit pagoda) and standalone `scripture_pavilion`.

## 0.8.1-fix1

### Fixed

- Closed side-wall holes on gabled buildings: `gable_roof()` now fills each
  gable-end column from the eave up to the true roof skin directly above it
  (climbing to the real `ridge_y`), and backs any cell carrying only a roof
  stair with a full gable block one step inboard. Apex gaps, edge gaps where
  an overhung slope arrived late, and see-through half-block roofline cells
  are gone.
- Stopped interior furniture mounting on a neighbour volume's exterior wall:
  the blacksmith `smithy` zone is now inset like `forge`/`storage`, and
  `spots_along_walls()` only mounts on a wall cell belonging to the zone's own
  volume. Leaked anvils/barrels/furnaces against the main wall are eliminated.
- Replaced the gable-triangle 60/40 dark-roof-plank mix with a style-declared
  gable infill: stone styles (`cultivation_sect`, `chinese_courtyard`,
  `cultivation_town`) get a solid `WALL_MAIN` gable with no scattered dark
  planks; `medieval_village` opts into a timber-infill look via a new optional
  `GABLE_INFILL` slot. Each gable cell is tagged with the slot it holds.
- Connection openings are now carved only on real (non-open) walls and clear of
  the parent facade's post/window/door columns (re-sealing any crossed post),
  via a new post-facade `connection_carve_pass`. Chimney placement offsets or
  flips around an abutting `side_wing`/shed instead of force-overwriting its
  facade/structure wall cells. Small wings/sheds now always keep a one-row
  stone plinth (`wall_frame` floors `stone_rows` at 1 for `wall_h >= 3`).

### Added

- Two build-quality hard-error checks that gate export: `open_side_wall`
  (every closed gable-family volume's wall plane must be enclosed from the
  foundation top to its roofline, modulo planned openings) and
  `furniture_on_wall` (no `INTERIOR`/`PROTECTED` non-opening block may sit
  against a different volume's exterior wall). These inspect the actual wall
  plane, not just cells a roof op recorded.
- Optional `GABLE_INFILL` material slot (registered in
  `OPTIONAL_MATERIAL_SLOTS`).

### Changed

- `flat_wall` counting now excludes roof-skin (gable-infill) facade cells so
  the new solid gable is not flagged as a flat run.

### Deferred

- Opposite-wall post-layout sharing and side/back speckle clamping were
  evaluated and dropped: both destabilized byte-stable output without offsetting
  payoff, per the change's §6 "drop if it destabilizes" clause.

## 0.8.1

### Added

- Rebuilt the cultivation `sweeping_eave_roof` silhouette as a real flying-eave
  (飞檐翘角) curve instead of a straight gable with corner bumps. The eave line
  now droops at mid-span and swoops up toward each gable end via a per-column
  corner-lift heightfield, and each eave side runs through a flat eave band
  (举折) before climbing to a level ridge. `tiered_eave_roof` inherits the curve
  on every tier. All geometry stays stair/slab-only; no new mod is required.
- Added a slot-resolved dougong / 额枋 bracket course (`DETAIL_WOOD` `_fence`)
  set under the deep eaves of sweeping-eave roofs; styles without the slot skip
  it, so mortal roofs are unchanged.
- Strengthened `tools/check_cultivation_forms.py` to assert the eave actually
  lifts at the corner and that eave brackets are placed, locking the curve
  against regression.

## 0.8.0-fix5

### Fixed

- Fixed horizontal wall-mounted plaque column placement so north/east-facing
  facades read inscriptions in exterior-view order instead of reversing names
  such as `庄园正门` and `藏经阁`.
- Added generated-structure validation for horizontal wall plaque visual
  column order to catch reversed multipart `col` sequences.

## 0.8.0-fix4

### Fixed

- Changed plaque inscription rendering from per-tile baked calligraphy PNGs to
  one full plaque texture per bound frame/mount/orientation, with each
  multipart block model sampling its own UV window from that full texture.
- Preserved HD inscription resolution in generated full plaque textures
  instead of downsampling calligraphy to 16x16 block parts.
- Updated offline preview rendering and plaque binding validation to understand
  full plaque textures plus model UV windows.

## 0.8.0-fix3

### Fixed

- Fixed generated multipart plaque frame textures so `inner_left` and
  `inner_right` tiles no longer render as outer border columns.
- Refit baked inscription artwork into the full plaque interior instead of
  stretching each source texture across the whole multipart target.
- Retinted low-contrast inscription sources against their plaque surface so
  dark calligraphy remains visible on dark wood and lacquer signboards.
- Extended plaque binding validation to check generated block textures for
  visible-but-not-overfilled inscription pixels.

## 0.8.0-fix2

### Fixed

- Reworked plaque inscriptions from runtime `minecraft:painting` entities into
  block-native baked plaque textures, eliminating the vanilla hanging-entity
  survival path that could break inscriptions into dropped painting items.
- Added distinct multipart plaque row/column states for 4w, 5w, and 4h plaques
  so every tile can display the correct slice of the calligraphy texture.
- Updated generated-structure validation to reject `myvillage:inscription/...`
  painting entities in shipped structures.

## 0.8.0-fix1

### Fixed

- Fixed custom calligraphy paintings rendering as missing black-purple textures
  in game by shipping inscription PNGs under the painting atlas path
  `assets/myvillage/textures/painting/inscription/`.
- Fixed even-height plaque painting anchors so 5w_2h and vertical inscriptions
  no longer shift upward, lose support, and drop as vanilla painting items.
- Updated plaque blocks to provide a full hanging support shape without
  colliding with the painting entity in front of the plaque.

## 0.8.0

### Added

- Added four shipped `myvillage` plaque blocks: wall, vertical wall, hanging,
  and vertical hanging plaque variants.
- Added an eight-preset plaque frame catalog with generated blockstates,
  models, frame textures, and artist-facing asset documentation.
- Added image-based inscription plaques through `painting_variant` resources
  and v1 HD calligraphy textures.
- Added data-driven archetype-to-plaque bindings for shops, inns, taverns,
  manors, sect gates, paifang, scripture pavilions, and treasure pavilions.
- Added hanging-plaque chain integration plus preview support for plaque block
  textures and inscription painting overlays.

### Changed

- Extended generated-structure, style-policy, and fallback validators with a
  `myvillage:` self-namespace carve-out while keeping external-mod validation
  strict.
- Extended offline previews and acceptance prep to report missing inscription
  assets and validate plaque binding data.

## 0.7.1

### Added

- Rebuilt cultivation town and sect building form around raised platforms,
  columned entries, balustrades, dougong-style brackets, mountain gates,
  pagoda massing, and alchemy-room furnace features.
- Added sweeping-eave, hip, pyramidal, and revised tiered-eave roof handlers
  for cultivation styles.

### Changed

- Replaced Western retagged cultivation structures with cultivation-specific
  building graphs and validation rules that reject porch, chimney, and other
  Western domestic tells in cultivation families.
- Extended cultivation validation, preview, and acceptance documentation for
  the rebuilt form vocabulary and sect compound checks.

## 0.7.0-fix2

### Fixed

- Restored Supplementaries awning canopies on market stalls and generated
  fence posts plus solid roof beams behind each awning so attached placement
  survives in game.
- Extended generated-structure validation to reject unsupported
  `supplementaries:awning_*` blocks.

## 0.7.0-fix1

### Fixed

- Fixed optional-mod decor motifs that placed attached blocks without valid
  support, causing sect-gate signs/displays or Supplementaries awnings to drop
  or disappear during in-game structure placement.
- Changed free-standing market stall canopies to use stable `ROOF_TILE`
  stairs/slabs instead of wall-attached awnings, while keeping modded market
  fittings visible under the `full` profile.
- Extended generated-structure validation to reject unsupported wall-attached
  sign/banner blocks.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- Added generated runtime fallbacks for optional decor-mod block ids and routed
  `/myvillage place` plus `/myvillage town` template loading through the
  fallback resolver so absent decor mods degrade to vanilla blocks instead of
  air.
- Added optional NeoForge dependency declarations for Ars Nouveau, Farmer's
  Delight, Supplementaries, Fetzi's Displays, Macaw's Furniture, and Macaw's
  Windows.
- Added fallback-map validation for shipped structure palettes.

## 0.6.0-fix3

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime `/myvillage town` site-fit placement so building templates use
  their `y=1` ground layer against the parcel surface and receive a continuous
  footprint support layer, preventing one-block hollow gaps under houses.
- Extended the runtime town-plan validator to check the shipped templates'
  ground-layer convention used by the Java realizer.

## 0.6.0-fix2

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime `/myvillage town` ground-detail placement so campfires,
  lantern posts, and central street-room furniture are anchored to parcel
  ground, free side-yard cells, or actual street cells instead of roof
  heightmap hits after templates are placed.
- Extended the runtime town-plan validator to check smoke/light detail space
  and street-room furniture candidate cells.

## 0.6.0-fix1

### Fixed

- Fixed the runtime `/myvillage town` plan geometry so all seed-selected lane
  offsets keep parcels, negative-space regions, and placed template footprints
  disjoint from streets.
- Added a runtime town-plan regression validator for the Java layout variants.

## 0.6.0

### Added

- Added `/myvillage town [seed]`, an on-demand runtime living-town generator
  with a closed wall, gates, main-street spine, dominant landmark, terrain
  plinths, active frontage, street furniture, smoke/light, wear, and daily-life
  props.
- Added deterministic town-plan data, validation, budget checks, JSON dumps,
  and top-down PNG/HTML plan previews.
- Added frontage metadata and optional importance-tier hooks to generated
  town building graphs.
- Split `/myvillage gallery` into the full gallery plus
  `/myvillage gallery original` and `/myvillage gallery cultivation`.

### Changed

- Rebound `cultivation_town` to the runtime town-generation layout while
  preserving the existing courtyard-street block outputs as reusable parts.
- Extended cultivation town validation to require resolvable frontage metadata
  on embedded town building parts.

### Documentation

- Updated command, preview, validation, and acceptance docs for the living-town
  flow.

## 0.5.1

### Added

- Added the `cultivation_town` courtyard-street block library:
  `cultivation_town_001.nbt` through `cultivation_town_006.nbt`.
- Added small-courtyard and courtyard-street block generation/validation,
  including street, lane, party-wall, gate-orientation, and traversability
  checks.

### Changed

- Changed the `cultivation_town` settlement group from standalone structures to
  the `courtyard_street_block` layout strategy.
- Updated command and acceptance documentation for
  `/myvillage place cultivation_town_001` and the cultivation town gallery.

### Removed

- Removed the old standalone cultivation town NBT/place-function outputs from
  the default generated resource set.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Generated civic structures, cultivation town structures, standalone
  cultivation sect structures, and cultivation sect compound structures.
- Grouped gallery support for civic, cultivation town, and cultivation sect
  columns.
