# Changelog

All notable project changes should be recorded here when a version is prepared.

## Versioning Rules

- Large feature additions bump the middle version component and reset the patch
  component: `0.x.y` -> `0.(x+1).0`.
- Small feature additions bump the patch component: `0.x.y` -> `0.x.(y+1)`.
- Single verified fixes keep the base version and add an ordered fix suffix:
  `0.x.y-fix1`, `0.x.y-fix2`, and so on.
- A fix suffix should only be added after the fix passes the relevant
  validation or build step.
- Any version change must update `gradle.properties`,
  `src/main/resources/META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`, README jar-name examples,
  and this changelog in the same change.

## Unreleased

## 0.7.0-fix2

### Fixed

- Restored Supplementaries awning canopies on market stalls and generated
  fence posts plus solid roof beams behind each awning so attached placement
  survives in game.
- Extended generated-structure validation to reject unsupported
  `supplementaries:awning_*` blocks.

## 0.7.0-fix1

### Fixed

- Fixed optional-mod decor motifs that placed attached blocks without valid
  support, causing sect-gate signs/displays or Supplementaries awnings to drop
  or disappear during in-game structure placement.
- Changed free-standing market stall canopies to use stable `ROOF_TILE`
  stairs/slabs instead of wall-attached awnings, while keeping modded market
  fittings visible under the `full` profile.
- Extended generated-structure validation to reject unsupported wall-attached
  sign/banner blocks.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- Added generated runtime fallbacks for optional decor-mod block ids and routed
  `/myvillage place` plus `/myvillage town` template loading through the
  fallback resolver so absent decor mods degrade to vanilla blocks instead of
  air.
- Added optional NeoForge dependency declarations for Ars Nouveau, Farmer's
  Delight, Supplementaries, Fetzi's Displays, Macaw's Furniture, and Macaw's
  Windows.
- Added fallback-map validation for shipped structure palettes.

## 0.6.0-fix3

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime `/myvillage town` site-fit placement so building templates use
  their `y=1` ground layer against the parcel surface and receive a continuous
  footprint support layer, preventing one-block hollow gaps under houses.
- Extended the runtime town-plan validator to check the shipped templates'
  ground-layer convention used by the Java realizer.

## 0.6.0-fix2

### Fixed

- Fixed runtime `/myvillage town` ground-detail placement so campfires,
  lantern posts, and central street-room furniture are anchored to parcel
  ground, free side-yard cells, or actual street cells instead of roof
  heightmap hits after templates are placed.
- Extended the runtime town-plan validator to check smoke/light detail space
  and street-room furniture candidate cells.

## 0.6.0-fix1

### Fixed

- Fixed the runtime `/myvillage town` plan geometry so all seed-selected lane
  offsets keep parcels, negative-space regions, and placed template footprints
  disjoint from streets.
- Added a runtime town-plan regression validator for the Java layout variants.

## 0.6.0

### Added

- Added `/myvillage town [seed]`, an on-demand runtime living-town generator
  with a closed wall, gates, main-street spine, dominant landmark, terrain
  plinths, active frontage, street furniture, smoke/light, wear, and daily-life
  props.
- Added deterministic town-plan data, validation, budget checks, JSON dumps,
  and top-down PNG/HTML plan previews.
- Added frontage metadata and optional importance-tier hooks to generated
  town building graphs.
- Split `/myvillage gallery` into the full gallery plus
  `/myvillage gallery original` and `/myvillage gallery cultivation`.

### Changed

- Rebound `cultivation_town` to the runtime town-generation layout while
  preserving the existing courtyard-street block outputs as reusable parts.
- Extended cultivation town validation to require resolvable frontage metadata
  on embedded town building parts.

### Documentation

- Updated command, preview, validation, and acceptance docs for the living-town
  flow.

## 0.5.1

### Added

- Added the `cultivation_town` courtyard-street block library:
  `cultivation_town_001.nbt` through `cultivation_town_006.nbt`.
- Added small-courtyard and courtyard-street block generation/validation,
  including street, lane, party-wall, gate-orientation, and traversability
  checks.

### Changed

- Changed the `cultivation_town` settlement group from standalone structures to
  the `courtyard_street_block` layout strategy.
- Updated command and acceptance documentation for
  `/myvillage place cultivation_town_001` and the cultivation town gallery.

### Removed

- Removed the old standalone cultivation town NBT/place-function outputs from
  the default generated resource set.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- Generated civic structures, cultivation town structures, standalone
  cultivation sect structures, and cultivation sect compound structures.
- Grouped gallery support for civic, cultivation town, and cultivation sect
  columns.
